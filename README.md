This is my repository following the course [Data access using .NET, C#, Dapper and SQL Server](https://balta.io/player/assistir/63c6ef55-44ee-445d-9b53-62e06fc969b8/f44f5e23-594d-4ac3-8b40-4ce263f30199) from [Balta.io](https://balta.io/)

### In this course I learned:
- **[Dapper](https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper)**, a micro ORM produced by [Stack Overflow Team](https://stackoverflow.com) to solve common data access problems, but using a lightweight ORM.
- **[Dapper.Contrib](https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper.Contrib)**, an object mapper for .Net that contains a number of helper methods for inserting, getting, updating and deleting records.
- How to create generic repositories.
- How to create dedicated repositories inheriting from generic repositories.

#### Notice
- The [SQL script](CourseProject/script.sql) is for SQL Server.
- You can access the certificate **[here](https://balta.io/certificados/e4a08d9c-1d5f-44ad-8464-65ef86884301)**
